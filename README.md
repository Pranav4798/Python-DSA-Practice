# 🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my DSA practice repository!  
This repo tracks my journey to strengthen problem-solving skills in **Python**, focusing on **core algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in fundamental data structures and algorithms.  
- Improve problem-solving speed and clarity of approach.  
- Prepare for technical interviews and sharpen logical thinking.  
- Document learnings clearly to serve as a future reference for myself and others.
